EEG data was converted to Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) format, with the goal of improving standardization and interoperability using two different methods: utilizing the FieldTrip toolbox and BIDS guidelines. The FieldTrip method is a more established and effective method for transforming data. This transition is essential for organizing data in a more accessible and generalizable way.
